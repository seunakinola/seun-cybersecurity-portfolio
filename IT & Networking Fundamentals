# Module 1: Designing Cybersecurity-Aware IT Infrastructure for a Small Office

## Description
This project simulates the setup of a secure small-office IT infrastructure using a **Windows 11 host** and an **Ubuntu 22.04 Linux virtual machine**. The goal is to demonstrate secure communication between platforms, cloud file integration, and basic firewall configuration in a home office or small business setting.

---

## Objectives
- Establish secure bridged network connectivity between host and VM
- Enable cross-platform file sharing via Google Drive
- Troubleshoot network restrictions (e.g., Windows firewall ICMP settings)
- Document a repeatable process for configuring VMs and network settings

---

## Technologies Used
- Windows 11 Pro
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (VirtualBox VM)
- Oracle VirtualBox (Bridged Adapter mode)
- Google Drive (cloud integration)
- Windows Defender Firewall
- CLI tools: `ipconfig`, `ping`, `ifconfig`, `ip a`

---

## Implementation Steps
1. Installed VirtualBox on Windows host
2. Created and configured Ubuntu VM with:
   - 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM, 25GB disk
   - Bridged networking adapter
3. Verified IP addresses and connectivity between systems using ping
4. Uploaded test files to Google Drive from both OSes to verify cloud access
5. Resolved a ping failure by enabling inbound ICMP Echo Request on Windows Firewall

---

## Results
- Both systems were reachable within the same subnet (192.168.1.0/24)
- Google Drive was accessible from both systems for secure file sharing
- Network security and firewall behavior was verified through practical testing

---

## Files Included
- `Module 1 Project.docx` â€“ Full documentation of the project steps and configuration

---

## Outcome
This project serves as a foundational exercise in designing secure, hybrid IT environments using virtualization and basic network security principles. It demonstrates practical troubleshooting, system configuration, and documentation skills needed in real-world cybersecurity roles.
